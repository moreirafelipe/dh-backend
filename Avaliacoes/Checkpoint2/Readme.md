# Spring Boot OdontoClinic Rest Api Service



This is a simple Java / Maven / Spring Boot (version 2.5.6) application that provides appointments services between dentists and patients through Spring Boot JPA CRUD Rest Api operations with JSON entities validation  through Spring-Boot-Starter dependency and  **global \*@ExceptionHandler\* with the \*@ControllerAdvice\* annotation** . You can use Postman to test the service.

### üåê About the Api Rest Service

This project intends to provide CRUD operations through Rest API service for a fictional odontology clinic. Basically, it counts on:

- Patients module and dentists module;

- Business classes;
- Data access classes using ORM;
- Classes of service;
- Controller classes;
- MVC layers;
- Use of good practices:

- Used MAVEN to manage dependencies on libraries and frameworks;
- Implemented a layered enterprise application architecture and dependency injection;
- Used the MVC pattern provided by the Spring Framework;
- Used an ORM for data access and persistence;
- Kept the application log record with Log4J to facilitate troubleshooting (troubleshooting) in case of errors;
